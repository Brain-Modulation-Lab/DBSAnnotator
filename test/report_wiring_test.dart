// Regression cover for how the SCREEN wires the report builders — the seams
// where correct components were being combined incorrectly.
//
// Each test here pins a bug that shipped: the report was built from a second,
// independently-computed data object (so `DateTime.now()` ran twice and an
// export at midnight could print two dates); the Step-2 scale bounds were never
// passed, so the chart axis and the whole ranking silently used a 0-10 default;
// and the sanitiser's "characters were replaced" flag had nowhere to go.
